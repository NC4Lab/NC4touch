   ping 169.254.55.240
   ```

3. If the ping is successful, SSH into the Raspberry Pi:
   ```bash
   ssh nc4@169.254.55.240
   ```
   If you get a warning about the hot key changing open:
   ```
   C:\Users\lester\.ssh\known_hosts
   ```
   Delete the line:
   ssh-keygen -R 169.254.55.240

4. When prompted:
   - Type `yes` to continue connecting.
   - Enter the password: `1434`.

5. After connecting via SSH, varify the Wi-Fi connection:
   ```
   ping -c 4 google.com
   ```

## Set up search by prefix functionality (Optional)
   
   1. Open the ~/.bashrc file for editing:
   ```
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```
   
   2. Add the following lines to your ~/.bashrc:
   ```
   # Enable history search with up/down arrows
   bind '"\e[A": history-search-backward'
   bind '"\e[B": history-search-forward'
   ```

   3. Save the pashrc and source it:
   ```
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

## Setup User Permisions for GPIO and SPI (Optional?)

1. Add the User to the gpio and spi Groups
   To ensure the user can access GPIO and SPI without sudo, run:
   ```
   sudo usermod -aG gpio,spi $(whoami)
   ```

2. Reboot the Raspberry Pi:
   ```
   sudo reboot
   ```

3. Check Group Membership
   Verify that the user has been added to the gpio and spi groups:
   ```
   groups
   ```
   Ensure the output includes both gpio and spi.

4. Test GPIO Pin Configuration:
   
   Install libgpiod Tools:
   Install the GPIO tools package to manage GPIO on the Raspberry Pi 5:
   ```
   sudo apt install gpiod -y
   ```
   
   Check GPIO Line Information:
   Use the gpioinfo command to list all GPIO lines and their statuses:
   ```
   gpioinfo
   ```
   If this command executes without errors and lists GPIO details, you have sufficient permissions to access GPIO.

5. Check SPI Setup

   Check if the SPI device files are available:
   ```
   ls /dev/spi*
   ```
   Output should show:
   ```
   /dev/spidev0.0
   /dev/spidev0.1
   ```

   Check the status of the SPI kernel module:
   ```
   lsmod | grep spi
   ```
   The output should include lines like:
   ```
   spi_bcm2835            49152  0
   ```

   Check the permissions of the SPI device files:
   ```
   ls -l /dev/spi*
   ```
   Example output:
   ```
   crw-rw---- 1 root spi 153, 0 Dec 10 10:00 /dev/spidev0.0
   crw-rw---- 1 root spi 153, 1 Dec 10 10:00 /dev/spidev0.1
   ```

   /dev/i2c-1
   /dev/i2c-3 (or some other number sufix)
   /dev/i2c-4 (or some other number sufix)
   ```
   
# Setting up the ili9488 driver

1. Update the Pi and reboot
   
   ```
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   sudo reboot
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   
   ```
   sudo apt install git bc bison flex libssl-dev libncurses5-dev -y
   sudo apt-get install raspberrypi-kernel-headers -y
   ```
   
   Confirm the Raspberry Pi kernel headers were installed correctly by checking if the /build directory exists (Optional):
   ```
   ls /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build
   ```

3. Build the driver
  
   ```
   cd /home/nc4/TouchscreenApparatus/src/lcd/ili9488
   make
   ```
   
   Verify the file was created:
   ```
   ls ili9488.ko
   ```

4. Compile the driver
   
   Copy the kernel module to the appropriate directory:
   ```
   sudo cp ili9488.ko /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/gpu/drm/tiny/
   ```
   Update module dependencies to include the new driver:
   ```
   sudo depmod
   ```
   Confirm that the driver is available:
   ```
   modinfo ili9488
   ```

5. Set up the device tree overlay
   
   Navigate to the directory containing the ili-9488.dts file:
   ```
   cd /home/nc4/TouchscreenApparatus/src/lcd/ili9488/rpi-overlays
   ```
   
   Compile the overlay file to a .dtbo binary:
   ```
   sudo dtc -@ -I dts -O dtb -o /boot/overlays/ili-9488.dtbo ili-9488.dts
   ```
   
   Edit the config.txt file to include the overlay and set SPI parameters:
   ```
   sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt
   ```
  
   Add the following lines to the end:
   ```
   # ili9488 overlay and SPI parameters
   dtoverlay=ili-9488
   dtparam=speed=62000000
   dtparam=rotation=90
   ```
   
   Reboot:
   ```
   sudo reboot
   ```
   
   Verify the overlay's boot application using:
   ```
   dmesg | grep -i 'ili9488'
   ```
   Expected outcomes: Should see `Initialized ili9488` 
   
   Run the following command to ensure the ili-9488 was successfully loaded:
   ```
   ls /proc/device-tree/overlays/ili-9488
   ```
   Expected outcomes: the directory exists and contains files like `status` and `name.
   
   Check for errors in the .dtbo
   ```
   sudo dtc -I dtb -O dts -o /dev/null /boot/overlays/ili-9488.dtbo
   ```

6. Temporarily reinable HDMI to use a monitor 
   
   You cannot use a monitor (HDMI) with the ILI9488 driver installed.
   
   Disable the dtoverlay for the ILI9488:
   ```
   sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt
   ```
   
   Comment out the line:
   ```
   #dtoverlay=ili-9488
   ```
  
   Change this back when you need to use the ILI9488 driver.

# Debugging the ili9488 driver

## Commands
- Check Kernel Logs for Overlay Errors
   ```
   dmesg | grep -i 'overlay'
   ```

- Verify the overlay's boot application using:
   ```
   dmesg | grep -i 'ili9488'
   ```

- Directly Inspect the Alias Mapping: Run:
   ```
   cat /sys/firmware/devicetree/base/aliases/gpio
   ```

- Manually load the overlay at runtime to get immediate feedback:
   ```
   sudo dtoverlay ili-9488
   dmesg | tail -50
   ```

- Decompile the .dtbo to a .dts
   ```
   sudo dtc -I dtb -O dts -o /home/nc4/TouchscreenApparatus/debug/ili-9488.dts /boot/overlays/ili-9488.dtbo
   ```

- Turn the backlight on (maximum brightness):
   ```
   echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/soc:backlight/brightness
   ```
- Turn the backlight off:
   ```
   echo 0 | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/soc:backlight/brightness
   ```

- Check for SPI 
   ```
   ls /dev/spi*
   ```


## Identified issues


1. The `.dtbo` File Exists in `/boot/overlays/`
   - Verified that the file is present using:
     `ls /boot/overlays/ili-9488.dtbo`

2. The `ili9488` Driver is Loaded Successfully (but Without GPIO Configuration)
   - The driver initializes and creates a framebuffer (`/dev/fb0`), confirmed by:
     `dmesg | grep -i ili9488`
   - Example output indicates successful driver initialization:
     `[drm] Initialized ili9488 1.0.0 20230414 for spi0.0 on minor 0`
     `ili9488 spi0.0: [drm] fb0: ili9488drmfb frame buffer device`
   - Issue: GPIO configuration for `reset`, `dc`, and `backlight` is missing, likely due to overlay failure.

3. The Kernel Fails to Load the Overlay
   - Listing overlays under `/proc/device-tree/overlays/` confirms the overlay is not applied:
     `ls /proc/device-tree/overlays/ili-9488`
   - Output:
     `ls: cannot access '/proc/device-tree/overlays/ili-9488': No such file or directory`
   - Issue: The kernel fails to apply the overlay due to errors in the `.dtbo` file.

4. The `.dtbo` File Contains Errors or Warnings
   - Decompiling the `.dtbo` file with `dtc` reveals the following issues:
     - Mismatched `#address-cells` and `#size-cells`.
     - Unresolved GPIO phandle references (`reset-gpios`, `dc-gpios`, `backlight`).
   - Verified using:
     `sudo dtc -I dtb -O dts -o /dev/null /boot/overlays/ili-9488.dtbo`
   - Example output:
     `Warning (unit_address_vs_reg): node has a unit name, but no reg or ranges property`
     `Warning (gpios_property): Could not get phandle node for GPIO references`

5. The Overlay Fails to Apply on Boot or Manually
   - No overlay-related logs appear in `dmesg` after boot, even with `dtdebug=on`:
     `dmesg | grep -i overlay`
   - Output:
     `(empty)`
   - Attempting to apply the overlay manually fails:
     `sudo dtoverlay ili-9488`
     Output:
     `Failed to apply overlay '0_ili-9488' (kernel)`

6. The Device Tree Shows SPI Issues
   - The `/dev/spidev0.1` node is created, but `/dev/spidev0.0` is missing.
   - Attempting to load `spi0-1cs` or `spi0-2cs` overlays does not resolve the missing `/dev/spidev0.0` issue.
   - The base device tree (`/proc/device-tree/soc/spi@7e204000`) shows SPI0 is enabled (`status = "okay";`), but CS0 is not exposed.

7. Phandle Resolution Errors Persist in the `.dtbo`
   - `reset-gpios`, `dc-gpios`, and `backlight` references fail to resolve during overlay compilation, likely due to missing or improperly linked nodes in the base device tree.
   - The `target = <0xffffffff>;` placeholder for the SPI node in the decompiled `.dtbo` suggests the overlay is failing to link to the `spi0` node in the base device tree.

8. Backlight Node Seems Misconfigured
   - The `backlight` property resolves to `<0x02>` in the decompiled `.dtbo`, but it’s unclear whether `<0x02>` correctly maps to GPIO 22 or another valid backlight controller.
   - Manually setting GPIO 22 (backlight) works to turn the backlight on, confirming the driver is not properly controlling it.

9. Framebuffer Works but the Display Shows No Output
   - The framebuffer (`/dev/fb0`) is initialized and sized correctly for the display (480x320), but no visible output appears.
   - SPI communication between the Pi and the ILI9488 controller is suspected to be non-functional.

10. ILI9488 Driver Version
    - The driver initializes with version `1.0.0 20230414`, but compatibility with the current kernel (`6.6.62+rpt-rpi-v8`) is unconfirmed. It’s worth exploring whether the driver needs to be patched or updated.

11. Confirm Overlay Compatibility with Kernel Version
    - The current `.dts` might not align with the updated Raspberry Pi kernel/device tree structure. Compare the `.dts` with a similar overlay known to work on the same kernel version (e.g., an Adafruit TFT overlay).
