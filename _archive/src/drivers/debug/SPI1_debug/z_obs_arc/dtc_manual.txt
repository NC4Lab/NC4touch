NAME
       dtc - Device Tree Compiler

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/bin/dtc [options] <input file>

DESCRIPTION
       Device Tree Compiler, dtc, takes as input a device-tree in a given format and outputs a device-tree in another format for booting kernels on embedded systems.  Typically, the input format is "dts", a human readable source format, and creates a "dtb", or binary format as output.

OPTIONS
       -h     Display help text.

       -q     Quiet:

	      -q - Suppress warnings.
	      -qq - Suppress errors.
	      -qqq - Suppress all.

       -I <input format>

	      Input formats are:

	      dts - device tree source text
	      dtb - device tree blob
	      fs - /proc/device-tree style directory

       -o <output file>

	      Dump the result into a file, instead of stdout.

       -O <output format>

	      Output formats are:

	      dts - device tree source text
	      dtb - device tree blob
	      asm - assembler source

       -V <output version>

	      Blob version to produce. The default is 17 (only relevant for dtb and asm output).

       -d <output dependency file>

       -R <number>

	      Make space for <number> reserve map entries (only relevant for dtb and asm output).

       -S <bytes>

	      Make the blob at least <bytes> long (extra space).

       -p <bytes>

	      Add padding to the blob of <bytes> long (extra space)

       -b <number>

	      Set the physical boot CPU.

       -f

	      Force - try to produce output even if the input tree has errors.

       -s

	      Sort nodes and properties before outputting (only useful for comparing trees)

       -v     Print DTC version and exit.

       -H <phandle format>

	      phandle formats are:

	      legacy - "linux,phandle" properties only
	      epapr - "phandle" properties only
	      both - Both "linux,phandle" and "phandle" properties
